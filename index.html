    <h1>Abstract Clocks</h1>
    <p>
      These gradiental clocks are the result of experimenting with abstract ways to represent time.
      <br><br>
      These clocks were built for <a href="https://www.electricobjects.com/">Electric Objects</a>, and can be put on display <a href="https://www.electricobjects.com/">here</a>. Source is on <a href="http://github.com/tholman/abstract-clocks">GitHub</a> & editable demo's on <a href="http://codepen.io/tholman/collection/clocks">CodePen</a>.

        Daily Rotation
      </h2>
      <p>
        This clock displays the time in 24 hour format. With the inner circle's dark edge, and the outer circles light edge pointing to the current time.
      </p>
      <b>For Example:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circles dark edge would be pointing perfectly to the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were 6AM the inner circles dark edge would be pointing to the right (3 oclock on a regular clock)
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were midday, the inner circles dark edge would be pointing directly down.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Hourly Rotation
      </h2>
      <p>
        This clock behaves similarly to a regular wall clock, with the inner circle's dark edge pointing where the minute hadn would, and the other pointing to where the hour hand would be.
      </p>
      <b>For Example:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circles and outer dark edge would be pointing perfectly to the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were 9.30AM the inner circles dark edge would be pointing to the bottom (30 minutes), and the outer edge pointing to the right (the 9 on a regular clock)
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were midday, again, both darker edges would be facing the top.
        </li>

        Rise and Fall
      </h2>
      <p>
        This clocks gradients rise and fall throughout the day. With the outer gradient mirroring the inner.
      </p>
      <b>For Example:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circle will be mostly filled with the darker orange, as though the sun was down.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were 6AM the inner circles gradient would be about centered, equal parts the ligher and darker colors.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were midday, the inner circle would be mostly light. From this point onwards, the gradients will receed with time, returning to the darker colors at midnight.

      <h2>
        Hourly Rise and Fall
      </h2>
      <p>
        This clocks inner gradient rises and then quickly falls once each hour, the outer gradient rises and falls gradually throughout the day.
      </p>
      <b>For Example:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circle will be mostly filled with the lighter white, as well as the outer gradient with the darker color.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were 6.30AM the inner circles gradient would be about centered, equal parts the ligher and darker colors. The outer, a little over 1/4 of the way up.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were 12.45, the inner circle would be mostly dark (75%). The outer gradient, will be mostly light, but will be falling back to dark again, as we've passed the middle of the day.

      <p>
        This clock is a color circle, rotating through time on a 12 hour schedule. The best way to understand it, is to know which colors match each time.
      </p>
      <b>For Example:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the time were 12 O'Clock, the clock would be split between yellows and greens.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were 6AM or PM, the clock would be spit between purples and reds.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time where 9AM or PM, the clock would be split between reds and oranges.
