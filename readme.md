## Abstract Clocks

These gradiental clocks are the result of the experimentation of representing time in abstract yet distict ways. Each clock has a different way of representing time, and are explained below. They'll make a lot more sense if you're [looking at the clock though](http://tholman.com/abstract-clocks)!

### Clocks!

#### 1 - Daily Rotation

This clock displays the time in 24 hour format. With the inner circle's dark edge, and the outer circles light edge pointing to the current time.

*For Example:*

- If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circles dark edge would be pointing perfectly to the top.
- If the time were 6AM the inner circles dark edge would be pointing to the right (3 oclock on a regular clock)
- If the time were midday, the inner circles dark edge would be pointing directly down.

#### 2 - Hourly Rotation
        
This clock behaves similarly to a regular wall clock, with the inner circle's dark edge pointing where the minute hadn would, and the other pointing to where the hour hand would be.

*For Example:*

- If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circles and outer dark edge would be pointing perfectly to the top.
- If the time were 9.30AM the inner circles dark edge would be pointing to the bottom (30 minutes), and the outer edge pointing to the right (the 9 on a regular clock)
- If the time were midday, again, both darker edges would be facing the top.

#### 3 - Rise and Fall

This clocks gradients rise and fall throughout the day. With the outer gradient mirroring the inner.

*For Example:*

- If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circle will be mostly filled with the darker orange, as though the sun was down.
- If the time were 6AM the inner circles gradient would be about centered, equal parts the ligher and darker colors.
- If the time were midday, the inner circle would be mostly light. From this point onwards, the gradients will receed with time, returning to the darker colors at midnight.

#### 4 - Hourly Rise and Fall

This clocks inner gradient rises and then quickly falls once each hour, the outer gradient rises and falls gradually throughout the day.

*For Example:*

- If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circle will be mostly filled with the lighter white, as well as the outer gradient with the darker color.
- If the time were 6.30AM the inner circles gradient would be about centered, equal parts the ligher and darker colors. The outer, a little over 1/4 of the way up.
- If the time were 12.45, the inner circle would be mostly dark (75%). The outer gradient, will be mostly light, but will be falling back to dark again, as we've passed the middle of the day.

#### 5 - Rainbow

This clock is a color circle, rotating through time on a 12 hour schedule. The best way to understand it, is to know which colors match each time.

*For Example:*

- If the time were 12 O'Clock, the clock would be split between yellows and greens.
- If the time were 6AM or PM, the clock would be spit between purples and reds.
- If the time where 9AM or PM, the clock would be split between reds and oranges.
