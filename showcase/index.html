    <h1>Gradient Clocks</h1>
    <p>
      These gradiental clocks are the result of the experimentation of representing time in abstract, yet distict ways. Each tells the time in a beautiful, readable way that nicely blurs the line between function and something else.

        24 Hour
      </h2>
      <p>
        This Clock displays the time in 24 hour format. With the inner circle's dark edge, and the outer circles light edge pointing to the current time.
      </p>
      <b>For Example:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circles dark edge would be pointing perfectly to the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were 6AM the inner circles dark edge would be pointing to the right (3 oclock on a regular clock)
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were midday, the inner circles dark edge would be pointing directly down.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        12 Hour
      </h2>
      <p>
        This Clock behaves a lot more similar to a regular wall clock, with the inner circle's dark edge pointing where the minute hadn would, and the other pointing to where the hour hand would be.
      </p>
      <b>For Example:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the time were 12 O'Clock (midnight) the inner circles and outer dark edge would be pointing perfectly to the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were 9.30AM the inner circles dark edge would be pointing to the bottom (30 minutes), and the outer edge pointing to the right (the 9 on a regular clock)
        </li>
        <li>
          If the time were midday, again, both darker edges would be facing the top.
        </li>
      </ul>
